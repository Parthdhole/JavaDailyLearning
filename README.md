here we can do pratical of ArryaList  
                                        iteralble(I)
                                          |
                                          |
                                      Collection(I)                                             map
                                           |                                                     |
                                           |                                                     |
                        List              set         queue                  HashMap        LinkedHashMap        TreeMap 



1.What is encapsulation? 
- binding the data as a single unit is called encapsulation we can achive the encapsulation by making the all variables private and using the getter setter methods
it help to achive 1)data hiding ,improve code security and I also help for loose coupling

      a)Why do we use Encapsulation?
      ->because it provide the controlled access and provide data integrity

     b)What is the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction?
        Encapsulation->hide the data by restricting direct access
                     ->Encapsulation is about how data is accessed

        Abstraction:-hides the implementation and shows only essential features.
                     abstraction is about what is shown to the user.

     c)Is Encapsulation the same as Data Hiding?
      ->Encapsulation supports data hiding, but both are not the same.
        
     d)Can we make methods private in Encapsulation?
       ->yes, but this method are for internal logics hiding like we cannot access this  method outside the class
